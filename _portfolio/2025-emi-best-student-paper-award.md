I am honored to have received the Best Student Paper Award at the ASCE Engineering Mechanics Institute (EMI) 2025 Fluid Dynamics Committee Student Paper Competition, held in Anaheim, Los Angeles.

My presentation, titled *"Machine Learning-Based Optimization for Enhancing Aerodynamic Performance of Multi-Row Ground-Mounted Solar Trackers,"* focused on improving the aerodynamic stability and wind resilience of solar energy systems through the integration of high-fidelity CFD simulations and machine learning-based shape optimization.

Receiving this recognition from Dr. Marco Giometto was a memorable highlight. I am sincerely grateful to the Fluid Dynamics Committee for this acknowledgment and the opportunity to contribute to such an inspiring research community.

I would especially like to thank my advisors, Dr. Yanlin Guo and Prof. Teng Wu, for their invaluable guidance and continued support, as well as my colleagues and everyone who has contributed to this work.
