I am thrilled to share that I have been awarded the \$5,000 Thornton Tomasetti Foundation Student Innovation Fellowship!
A huge thank you to the Thornton Tomasetti Foundation for providing me with this incredible opportunity to advance my research in optimizing the aerodynamics of solar trackers using machine learning.
This achievement wouldn't have been possible without the unwavering support of my advisor, Dr. Yanlin Guo, and our department head, Prof. Chuck Shackelford.
Your guidance and encouragement have been instrumental in this journey.

Looking forward to the exciting work ahead!
