A new wavelet‐Hilbert transform based sparse component analysis (WHT‐SCA) method is presented for online system identification in indeterminate conditions. The method extracts instantaneous phase ratios of output signals using a wavelet‐Hilbert based filter and removes out-of-phase data to improve accuracy. Modal parameters are then identified from the dispersion of filtered data in the frequency domain.

To demonstrate the method’s real-time potential, it is coupled with a semi-active tuned mass damper (STMD) to form a smart structural control system. The effectiveness of the identification strategy and control approach is validated through simulations, showing accurate and reliable identification of structural modal parameters under varying conditions.
