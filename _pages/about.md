Welcome to my academic homepage. I'm **Seyed Pejman Fatehi**, a PhD candidate in Structural Engineering at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado.

My research centers on the aerodynamic optimization and structural system identification of civil infrastructure, with a particular focus on wind-sensitive structures such as long-span bridges and single-axis solar trackers. I integrate advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with machine learning techniques to better understand and mitigate the effects of unsteady wind loading, including vortex-induced vibrations and torsional flutter. By leveraging high-fidelity numerical models and data-driven optimization frameworks, my work aims to improve the aerodynamic performance and structural resilience of these systems, ultimately contributing to safer and more energy-efficient engineering designs.
