Welcome to my academic homepage. I'm **Seyed Pejman Fatehi**, a PhD candidate in
Structural Engineering at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado.

My research focuses on aerodynamic optimization and structural system
identification. I combine computational fluid dynamics, sparse component
analysis and machine learning to enhance the wind resistance of civil
structures such as long-span bridges and solar trackers.

Recent highlights include receiving the Thornton Tomasetti Foundation Student
Innovation Fellowship and the EMI&nbsp;2025 Best Student Paper Award.

Browse the site for my publications, talks, teaching activities and portfolio
updates. For a full list of my activities, please see the [CV page](/cv/). Feel
